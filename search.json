    "text": "In 2018, the Baltimore Ravens took a chance picking Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson with the 32 overall pick in the NFL Draft. Jackson, a Heisman-Trophy winning dual-threat quarterback, who dazzled fans by running the ball better than he threw it. Drafting Jackson was an interesting pick, because the Ravens would have to revamp their entire offense around his interesting skill set and get rid of The GOAT Joe Flacco. During his first year on the Ravens, Jackson took over the offense and lit up the field. During his rookie contract he managed to have a 74-27 record in the regular season, however, injuries kept him sidelined for the end of the 2021 and 2022 seasons. The Ravens had a hard decision to make with the concerns of the longevity of Jackson’s career and paying a running back quarterback money. Throughout the contract negotiations Jackson had requested to be traded and the Ravens placed a non-exclusive franchise tag on him to try and get other teams to essentially make a market for Jackson. That didn’t work because no one wanted him and the market was over inflated because of massage enthusiast Deshaun Watson’s horrible fully guaranteed contract that the Cleveland Browns signed. The Ravens eventually paid Jackson, but did they make the right decision or was there a better answer? The choice was made even harder having the best backup quarterback in the NFL, Tyler Snoop Huntley who the Ravens let walk to the Dolphins.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\npass&lt;-read_csv(\"NFLPass24.csv\")\n\nQB &lt;- pass |&gt;\n  filter(Pos==\"QB\") |&gt;\n  filter(G&gt;1) |&gt;\n  filter(Cash&gt;1) |&gt;\n  filter(QBR&gt;10) |&gt;\n  filter(Yds&gt;=1) \n\nYPG &lt;- QB |&gt; \n  group_by(Player, Team, G, QBR, Cash, TD, Int,Yds) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    YardsPerGame = Yds/G,\nCashPerGame = Cash/G\n)\n\nTH &lt;-YPG|&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Tyler Huntley\")\n\nLJ &lt;-YPG |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Lamar Jackson\")\n\nBP&lt;-YPG |&gt;\n  filter(Player ==\"Brock Purdy\")\n\nJB&lt;-YPG |&gt;\n  filter(Player ==\"Joe Burrow\")\n\nKT&lt;-YPG |&gt;\n  filter(Player ==\"Kyle Trask\") \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=YPG, aes(x=YardsPerGame, y=QBR, size=Cash), color=\"darkgrey\", alpha=.3) + geom_point(data=JB, aes(x=YardsPerGame, y=QBR, size=Cash), color=\"orange\" ) +\ngeom_text_repel(data=JB, aes(x=YardsPerGame+65, y=QBR, label=Player)) +\ngeom_point(data=TH, aes(x=YardsPerGame, y=QBR, size=Cash), color=\"cyan\" ) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=TH, aes(x=YardsPerGame, y=QBR, label=Player)) +\n  geom_point(data=LJ, aes(x=YardsPerGame, y=QBR, size=Cash), color=\"purple\" ) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=LJ, aes(x=YardsPerGame, y=QBR, label=Player)) +\n   geom_point(data=BP, aes(x=YardsPerGame, y=QBR, size=Cash), color=\"red\" )+\n  geom_text_repel(data=BP, aes(x=YardsPerGame+10, y=QBR, label=Player)) +\n  geom_point(data=KT, aes(x=YardsPerGame, y=QBR, size=Cash), color=\"darkred\" ) +\ngeom_text_repel(data=KT, aes(x=YardsPerGame, y=QBR, label=Player))+\ngeom_vline(xintercept = 160.8224) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 51.01143  ) +\n  scale_size_continuous(labels=comma) + \n  theme_minimal()+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Passing Yards Per Game\", \n    y=\"Average Quarterback Rating\", \n    title=\"Things did not go swimmingly for the new Dolphin\", \n    subtitle=\"Tyler Huntley is a below average quarterback.

Tyler Huntley (cyan) was the backup in Miami, but due to injuries he got his chance to prove why the Ravens were wrong. In his five games he proved to be the most mediocre quarterback and makes me regret every take I have ever had. Especially since Lamar Jackson (purple) is above average in both metrics. The only downside is the original problem; his bubble is way larger than Huntley’s. Well, how does Lamar compare to other quarterbacks in his price range? Fellow AFC North quarterback, Joe Burrow had a slightly worse QBR but averaged more yards. What about Huntley? Mr. Irrelevant, Brock Purdy proved that you didn’t have to make money to be a good quarterback and that Tyler Huntley was actually not the bargain the Ravens were looking for. Who was the worst quarterback per dollar? Kyle Trask AKA Kyle Trash played four games for the Buccaneers and only gained five yards. For a whopping $352,248.60 per yard.\n\n\nCode\nScrim &lt;- read_csv(\"NFLScrim24.csv\")|&gt;\n  filter(Pos==\"QB\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    RushTDG = RushTD/G,\n    FmbG= Fmb/G\n  ) \n\nLJR &lt;- Scrim |&gt;\n  filter(Player==\"Lamar Jackson\")\n\nTHR &lt;- Scrim |&gt;\n  filter(Player==\"Tyler Huntley\")\n  \nYds &lt;-Scrim |&gt;\n  top_n(15, wt=`RushY/G`)\n\n  TD &lt;-Scrim |&gt;\n  top_n(15, wt=RushTDG)\n  \n  \n  Ydsbar&lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=Yds, aes(x=reorder(Player, `RushY/G`), weight=`RushY/G`)) +\n    geom_bar(data=LJR, aes(x=reorder(Player, `RushY/G`), weight=`RushY/G`), fill=\"purple\") +\n    geom_bar(data=THR, aes(x=reorder(Player, `RushY/G`), weight=`RushY/G`), fill=\"cyan\") +\n  coord_flip()+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Rushing yards per game\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"Duel threat is running the ball\", \n    subtitle=\"this is my subtitle.\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\nTDbar&lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=TD, aes(x=reorder(Player, RushTDG), weight=RushTDG)) +\n  geom_bar(data=LJR, aes(x=reorder(Player, RushTDG), weight=RushTDG), fill=\"purple\") +\n  geom_bar(data=THR, aes(x=reorder(Player, RushTDG), weight=RushTDG), fill=\"cyan\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Rushing touchdowns pre game\", \n    y=\"\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Joshua Carlson\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\nYdsbar + TDbar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wouldn’t be fair to judge these quarterbacks without looking at their legs. To no one’s surprise if you put a running back at quarterback, he’s going to lead quarterbacks in rushing yards per game. Tyler Huntley was also able to make the top 15 but almost averaged half as many yards. On the other hand, he was better at scoring rushing touchdowns than Jackson. So maybe the Ravens should have stuck with Huntley.\n\n\nCode\nTHI &lt;- c(\"Interceptions\"=3, \"Fumbles\"=6, 5)\nLJI &lt;- c(\"Interceptions\"=4, \"Fumbles\"=10)\n\niron(\n waffle(LJI, \n        rows = 2, \n   colors = c(\"black\", \"purple\")) + \n   labs(\n     x=\"Lamar Jackson Turnovers\",\n     title=\"The problems when you put a runningback at quarterback\", \n     subtitle=\"Tyler Huntly almost turned the ball over as much as Lamar in only five games.\") + \n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\n waffle(THI, \n        rows = 2,\n   colors = c(\"black\", \"cyan\", \"white\")) +\n   labs(\n     x = \"Tyler Huntley Turnovers\\n1 square = 1 turnover\",\n     caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Graphic by Joshua Carlson\"\n     )\n) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI regret everything I have ever said, and the entire project was a waste of time. Tyler Huntley managed to turn over the ball nine times in five games, only five fewer than Lamar did the entire season. Also, Lamar won his second MVP with 5,087 total scrimmage yards and 45 combined touchdowns. Not only was he a great running back, but Lamar actually learned how to throw the ball. Not much has changed today. After a few stops, Tyler Huntley is back with the Ravens as a backup, Lamar is still the clear starter with another bag on the way, and the Ravens still can’t win in the playoffs."
